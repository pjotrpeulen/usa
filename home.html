					<h5>Study abroad</h5>
					<p>I've been to the University of Mississippi, Mississippi tha dirty South of America! The University of Mississippi or Ole Miss as commonly referd to is located in Oxford, Mississippi, a small university town with a typical American college fibe. I've lived in University trails just below highway 6 and a 5 minute drive to campus or the square. The Square is the center of Oxford and the place were all the college kids hang about at night. All great bars were you can get yourself a nice cold, overpriced beer when you're 21+ or in the possession of a fake ID. Most nights were spend at the square or a nice house party where the preconceptions about American house parties were proven to be true. Redcups are everywhere, beerpong is at every houseparty, weet is smoked in the garden and upstairs boys play with a bag of flower. Hospitality is a great respected value in the south, so at every party you're welcomed like it yours. <br> I studied a semester from January till May and finished four great courses. Made a great group of internationals and American friends and traveled all across the States, from East to West, from South to North and all the way back home: Biloxi and Oxford, Mississippi! <br><br> Like this introduction story? <br> Continue to the storyline for a full detailed story to get the full picture, or go to the photobook and have a look in the great pics of this journy.</p>
