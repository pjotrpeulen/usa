					<h3 class="m-y-1">My journey through the States</h3>
					<h5>New York City</h5>
					<p>I've started my journey in the Big Apple. With the help of couchsurfing's community I came in contact with three amazing people with whom I've descovered New York City. As the great tourist I am, I been to nearly all highlights, such as Central park, Rockerfeller, Wall street, Ground Zero and more. I've seen the Statue of Liberty by taking the free ferry to Staten Island.</p>
				  <h5 class="p-t-1">Oxford, Mississippi</h5>
					<p>My second destination was gonna be Oxford, Mississippi, to study at Ole Miss. I flew from Newark, New Jearsey, to Memphis Tennessee where I was welcomed by an Ole Miss official. I made my first few mates on Memphis International Airport with whom I've spend a great semester, namely Benedict Minknr and Mark Heffer. A bus took us to Oxford, which is a hour driving and at University Trails my adventure awaited.</p>
          <h5 class="p-t-1">University Trails</h5>
          <p>University trails is the little shit whole were I've been staying during my semester abroad. It is not good, nor is it really bad. The rooms are fine, but a bit shaggy and I had to buy most of my essentials. However, I've had some great mates also living in University Trails, so together we had great fun. Charles, Gibong and Benny were just a short walk away so we could always hang about. Every weekend you could find a house party somewhere in Trails enough apartments to crash.</p>
          <br>
          <h5>Ole Miss</h5>
          <p>My first week at the University of Mississippi, aka Ole Miss, I've seen the campus, classrooms and enrolled in all my courses for that semester. I took Business and Professional Speech, Introduction to Linguistics, History of the USA since 1877, and History of the Muslim World from the Middle Ages untill World War I. For those who are interested in what I actually learned, which is a lot, I will write in detail later on.</p>
